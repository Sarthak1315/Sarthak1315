- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sarthak1315
As a student of BSc IT with a passion for Software development, I possess a strong foundation in ASP.NET (C#), JAVA, SQL, PHP,HTML, CSS, Adobe Photoshop, and C language. Although I do not have professional experience, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to create visually appealing and functional websites. I am a fast learner and possess excellent problem-solving skills, allowing me to adapt quickly to new technologies and programming languages. With a keen eye for detail and a strong work ethic, I am confident in my ability to contribute to web development projects and achieve outstanding results.
